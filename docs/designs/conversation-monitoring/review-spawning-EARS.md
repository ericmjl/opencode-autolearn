# Review Spawning - EARS

**Parent LLD**: ./LLD.md

## Threshold Triggering

- [x] **CM-RS-001**: When the turn counter minus the last review turn reaches `review_threshold` (default 5), the system shall trigger a review spawn.
- [x] **CM-RS-002**: After triggering a threshold-based review, the system shall record the current turn count as `lastReviewTurn`.

## Spawn Execution

- [x] **CM-RS-003**: When a review is triggered, the system shall check that the buffer is non-empty and no review is in progress before proceeding.
- [x] **CM-RS-004**: If the buffered message text contains the string "# Autolearn Review", the system shall skip the review spawn (depth guard against review-of-review).
- [x] **CM-RS-005**: The system shall set `reviewInProgress` to true before spawning and reset it to false after completion (success or failure).

## Review Formatting

- [x] **CM-RS-006**: The system shall format the buffered messages into a markdown document with Context section (project name, date, turn count), Instructions section, and Conversation section.
- [x] **CM-RS-007**: The system shall write the formatted review markdown to `~/.autolearn/reviews/review-{timestamp}.md`.

## Subprocess Spawning

- [x] **CM-RS-008**: The system shall spawn `opencode run <reviewMarkdown> --agent autolearn-reviewer --title "autolearn review"` as a detached subprocess.
- [x] **CM-RS-009**: The system shall set the `AUTOLEARN_REVIEWER=1` environment variable on the spawned subprocess to prevent recursive turn counting.
- [x] **CM-RS-010**: The spawned subprocess stdout and stderr shall be ignored (detached mode).

## Error Handling

- [x] **CM-RS-011**: If the review spawn fails, the system shall save the formatted review markdown to `~/.autolearn/review-failed-{timestamp}.md` for manual inspection.
- [x] **CM-RS-012**: If the review spawn fails, the system shall log the error message to the console with `[autolearn]` prefix.

## Observations Logging

- [x] **CM-RS-013**: When a review is spawned, the system shall append a JSON observation record to `~/.autolearn/observations.jsonl` with type "review_spawned", the message count, and the review file path.

## Stale Review Cleanup

- [x] **CM-RS-014**: After each review spawn, the system shall scan `~/.autolearn/reviews/` and delete files older than `stale_after_days` (default 30).

## Observations File Maintenance

- [x] **CM-RS-015**: The system shall trim `~/.autolearn/observations.jsonl` to a maximum of 1000 lines, discarding the oldest entries.
