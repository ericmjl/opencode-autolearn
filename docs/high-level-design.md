## Problem Statement

AI coding agents repeat the same mistakes across sessions because they have no mechanism to learn from user corrections, preferences, and recurring patterns. Every session starts from scratch, forcing users to re-state the same preferences and re-correct the same behaviors.

## Goals

1. **Automatic learning** — Capture user corrections and preferences from conversation flow without requiring explicit "remember this" commands. _(shipped)_
2. **Behavioral escalation** — Detect when a correction recurs across projects and escalate it into persistent agent instructions (AGENTS.md). _(shipped via `self-improving-agent/improve.py`)_
3. **Skill evolution** — Allow the agent to create, patch, and retire its own skills based on observed patterns. _(shipped)_
4. **Zero-friction operation** — Work as a background plugin that requires no user intervention during normal operation. _(shipped)_
5. **Cross-machine sync** — Propagate learned knowledge between machines via an E2E-encrypted sync service. _(shipped — AES-256-GCM crypto, sync CLI, Fastify + Convex backends, multi-persona, plugin auto-sync. See Decisions 5–7 and `docs/designs/sync/`.)_

## Non-Goals

- **Cross-agent synchronization** — Each agent harness manages its own autolearn store; no sync between Claude Code, Copilot, etc.
- **Cloud-based memory (plaintext)** — All data stays local by default. Sync is optional and E2E-encrypted; the server never sees plaintext.
- **Model fine-tuning** — Autolearn changes agent behavior via instructions and skills, not model weights.
- **Self-improving-agent invocation boundary** — The `improve.py` observation/escalation CLI is bundled in this repo (under `skills/self-improving-agent/`) but is **not invoked directly by the plugin** — only the reviewer agent calls it via the SKILL.md protocol. This keeps the plugin thin and lets the reviewer decide when a correction is worth recording.
- **Real-time collaborative editing** — Single-writer per persona per machine at a time.
- **Cross-user persona sharing** — Personas are private to one user (future: team personas with key exchange).

## Target Users

- **Developers using OpenCode** who want their coding agent to improve over time without manual configuration.
- **Agent skill authors** who want skills that can be patched and extended by the autolearn system.

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Plugin-based architecture (not standalone service)

**Choice**: OpenCode plugin that hooks into session events.

**Rationale**: Plugins have direct access to conversation events (message deltas, idle state) without requiring a separate process, network port, or API. The plugin is loaded in-process and can react to events in real time.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Standalone daemon with API: More complex, requires port management, adds network latency to event processing.
- Post-session script: Loses real-time idle detection and requires a separate trigger mechanism.

### Decision 2: Markdown-based data store

**Choice**: Plain markdown files (`memory.md`, `user-profile.md`) for persistent knowledge.

**Rationale**: OpenCode loads instruction files directly into agent context. Markdown files serve as both storage and context injection — no conversion needed. The agent reads the same file the user can edit.

**Alternatives considered**:
- SQLite: More queryable but not readable by the agent without tool calls. Adds a binary dependency.
- JSON: Structured but not human-readable and not directly loadable as instructions.

### Decision 3: Subprocess spawning for reviews

**Choice**: Spawn a separate `opencode run` subprocess for each review, with the `AUTOLEARN_REVIEWER=1` guard to prevent recursive review spawning.

**Rationale**: Reviews are expensive (full LLM call with skill loading). Running them in a subprocess isolates failures, prevents the main session from blocking, and naturally limits concurrency to one review at a time.

**Alternatives considered**:
- In-process background task: Risk of interfering with main session context, harder to isolate failures.
- Job queue: Over-engineered for a single-user local tool.

### Decision 4: Python CLI for data management

**Choice**: `autolearn.py` as a standalone Python script with PEP 723 inline metadata.

**Rationale**: The reviewer agent needs programmatic access to create/patch skills and update memory. A CLI is the simplest interface that both the agent (via bash) and the user (via terminal) can use. PEP 723 inline metadata means no virtualenv setup required — `uv run` handles it.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Node.js CLI: Would match the plugin language but the reviewer agent works better with Python for string processing and YAML manipulation.
- Direct file writes from the skill: Fragile, no validation, no deduplication logic.

### Decision 5: E2E-encrypted sync (zero-knowledge server) — _shipped_

**Choice**: Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption before syncing. The server stores only opaque ciphertext.

**Rationale**: Sync requires trusting a server with personal coding preferences and habits. E2E encryption means even the database operator (including the user viewing the Convex dashboard) cannot read the content. Master password → PBKDF2 → per-file encryption keys derived via HMAC chain. OS keychain stores the derived key for convenience.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Plaintext sync (trust the server): Simpler but unacceptable for privacy-sensitive learning data.
- Per-file symmetric keys without key hierarchy: Simpler but no isolation between personas.
- Asymmetric encryption (public key): Overkill for single-user data, adds complexity.

### Decision 6: Multi-persona knowledge stores — _shipped_

**Choice**: Each persona is an isolated subdirectory under `~/.autolearn/personas/{name}/` with its own complete set of files, synced independently.

**Rationale**: Developers operate in distinct contexts (work, personal, OSS) with different conventions and tooling. Mixing them into one memory store creates noise — a work-specific CI pattern isn't useful in personal projects. Personas are client-side namespaced (UUIDs on the server), so persona names like "work" never leave the machine.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Tags on entries instead of separate stores: Requires filtering on every read, no isolation.
- Multiple autolearn installations: Duplication, each needs its own plugin config.
- Single store with persona field: Leakage risk, complex filtering.

### Decision 7: Backend-agnostic sync API (Convex or self-hosted) — _shipped_

**Choice**: A thin sync API spec (push/pull/status) that any backend can implement. Ships with a Convex backend (managed, deployed under the project maintainer's account) and a self-hosted Fastify+SQLite backend (free, run on your own machine).

**Rationale**: Users should not be locked into a specific hosting provider. The managed Convex service is convenient (no server to operate), but fully self-hosting should be equally easy (Docker image or bare bun process). The CLI is backend-agnostic — it only needs a URL and API key.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Convex only: Lock-in, users must have a Convex account.
- Generic S3/object store: No conflict detection, no per-file metadata, no auth built in.
- Git-based sync: Merge conflicts on markdown bullet lists, requires git knowledge, no realtime.

### Decision 8: Store/view separation — registry + dynamic context composition — _shipped_

**Choice**: Replace the single static, 3000-char-capped `memory.md` with two
layers — a durable, unbounded `memories.jsonl` registry, and a per-session
`memory.context.md` generated by ranking records by relevance × retention into a
soft character budget.

**Rationale**: `memory.md` conflates *durability* (should this lesson survive?)
with *relevance* (should it be in this session's context?). A FIFO char cap
answers neither: it silently drops still-valid lessons (staleness) while their
reinforcement counters orphan in `strengths.json`, and it competes with the
Ebbinghaus curve's decay policy. Separating the store from the view lets
forgetting be driven by decay over an unbounded store, while the context window
gets the most useful (relevant + retained) tokens each session.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Keep `memory.md`, raise the cap: postpones staleness, does not fix the
  durability/relevance conflation or orphan strengths.
- SQLite-only store: more queryable but not directly loadable as instructions;
  the composer still emits the markdown view the agent reads.
- Embeddings for relevance: deferred — lexical Jaccard over topic tokens covers
  the recurring-preference case at zero dependency cost (see Decision 9).

### Decision 9: Ebbinghaus-governed forgetting, embedding-free — _shipped_

**Choice**: Each memory carries a decaying retention score
(`salience · e^(−λ·Δt) + σ·Σ(1/days_since_reinforcement)`); a record is evicted
only after staying below the cold tier for a grace period. Reinforcement
(boost), tiering, and contradiction detection all run on plain text + timestamps
— no vector embeddings anywhere in the lifecycle.

**Rationale**: Decay/strengthen/evict is orthogonal to retrieval. AgentMemory's
own retention engine and Jaccard contradiction detector are embedding-free
(embeddings only touch optional retrieval quality, where BM25-only still scores
86% R@5). Keeping autolearn embedding-free preserves its zero-new-deps,
`uv run`-only operation model and matches the user's "simple, agent-operable
tech" preference. Embeddings remain a future, optional upgrade to the composer's
relevance step alone.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Embeddings now: adds a model dependency + vector store for marginal gain on
  the recurring-preference detection that motivated the feature.
- Hand-rolled FIFO retention (status quo): causes the staleness and orphans this
  decision set out to fix.

### Decision 10: Falsify skills, not memories; against tool outcomes, not text — _in flight_

**Choice**: Certified Procedures targets **skills** (autolearn's program-analog)
and falsifies them against **ground-truth-bearing tool outcomes** indexed from
`opencode.db`'s `part` table (`tool` / `step-finish` rows), which the existing
FTS5 search index deliberately excludes (session-search DD4). It does **not**
backtest prose memories against prose snippets.

**Rationale**: The earlier "Certified Memory" concept was rejected on review.
Schema's backtest is valuable because it is *verifiable* (run the program →
compare to ground truth). A repo is not a closed deterministic system, so exact
replay is impossible — but `opencode.db` *does* carry structured
ground-truth-bearing evidence (106k+ tool parts incl. 2,485 errors; ~98k
step-finish token ledgers; 1,394 skill-load parts). Prose-vs-prose backtesting
retains none of Schema's verifiability and is polarity-blind and
drift-confounding; backtesting skills against tool outcomes does. The critical
epistemic rule: an outcome only falsifies where it carries a ground-truth bit
(test result > exit code > user correction > raw output).

**Alternatives considered**:
- Backtest prose memories against FTS5 conversation text: rejected — the index
  excludes tool outcomes by design, and lexical contradiction is unreliable.
- A perfect repo simulator (true Schema `step()`): rejected — a repo is open and
  non-deterministic; planning-inside-the-model is out of scope.

### Decision 11: Two co-equal loops (falsify + efficiency) on one outcome spine — _in flight_

**Choice**: Build the outcome index once (`outcomes.py`) and serve two loops:
**Loop 1 (falsify)** verifies skills deterministically and auto-demotes
failures; **Loop 2 (efficiency)** detects expensive roundabout tool sequences,
extracts the golden path, and promotes it — gated by Loop 1 verification.

**Rationale**: Falsification delivers *correctness* (procedures stay valid);
the golden-path loop delivers *efficiency* (don't rediscover the direct
invocation). They share the same substrate (the outcome index + step-cost
ledger) and compose: Loop 2 proposes a shortcut, Loop 1 verifies it before
promotion, so lucky one-off commands don't harden into bad shortcuts. Treating
them co-equal matches the goal of "an opencode that gets more efficient over
time," not just "tidier memory." Side benefit: indexing skill-load parts
auto-repairs the dead `.usage.json` reuse ledger (`use_count` is currently never
incremented).

**Alternatives considered**:
- Falsify-only, defer efficiency: cleaner sequencing but defers the
  token-savings payoff that motivated the feature.
- Efficiency-primary, falsify-secondary: inverts the safety layer; rejected
  because ungated shortcut promotion is the failure mode Loop 1 prevents.

### Decision 12: Deterministic falsification first; probabilistic is suggestion-only — _in flight_

**Choice**: Loop 1 evaluates `test-suite` and `declared` claims
deterministically and may auto-demote failures; correlation-based
(skill-load → subsequent outcomes) falsification is deferred and, when added,
is **suggestion-only — never auto-demote**.

**Rationale**: Deterministic checks carry ground truth, so acting on them
(auto-demote + flag) is safe. Probabilistic signals are drift-confounding and
false-positive-prone; routing them around the Ebbinghaus grace period would, on
present evidence, be net-negative. This honors the review finding that an
automated "hygiene" loop on a noisy signal makes the system worse than no-op.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Probabilistic-first (covers all skills immediately): rejected — weaker signal
  the review flagged; deterministic-first is the genuine Schema-grade path.
- Auto-demote on correlation: rejected — unsafe on a noisy, drift-blind signal.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Review spawning loops | `AUTOLEARN_REVIEWER=1` guard prevents recursive spawning; buffer depth check skips reviews containing review content |
| Lost conversation on exit | Process-level `beforeExit` and signal handlers dispatch a final review before shutdown |
| Memory bloat / staleness | _(Memory Insight)_ Durable unbounded `memories.jsonl` registry; forgetting driven by Ebbinghaus decay + grace-period eviction, not a FIFO char cap. Context window kept bounded by the relevance-ranked composer (soft budget). Legacy `memory.md` 3000-char FIFO cap retired post-migration. _(previously: 3000-char cap with oldest-first trimming — caused silent staleness + orphan strength records)_ |
| Stale review files | Auto-cleanup based on `stale_after_days` config |
| Secret leakage | Regex redaction of API keys, tokens, passwords from buffered messages |
| Concurrent writes | Review subprocess writes to unique timestamped files; no file-level contention |
| Sync server breach | Server stores only ciphertext — no plaintext exposure even with full DB access |
| Lost encryption key | Data is irrecoverable by design. `sync export-key` creates offline backup |
| Sync conflicts | Last-write-wins by timestamp; append-only merge for observations.jsonl |
| Persona isolation failure | Per-persona HMAC-derived keys — compromising one persona doesn't expose others |
