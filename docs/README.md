# Autolearn Design Docs

## Index

Start with the [High-Level Design](./high-level-design.md) — it has a status column on the Feature Breakdown table and marks each Key Decision as `shipped` or `planned`.

### Shipped features

| Behavioral Escalation | (covered in self-improving-agent SKILL) | — | `skills/self-improving-agent/SKILL.md`, `improve.py` |
| Sync Encryption | [LLD](./designs/sync/encryption-LLD.md) | [EARS](./designs/sync/encryption-EARS.md) | `scripts/sync_crypto.py`, `autolearn.py` (sync) |
| Sync Protocol | [LLD](./designs/sync/protocol-LLD.md) | [EARS](./designs/sync/protocol-EARS.md) | `autolearn.py` (sync), `sync-server/`, `sync-convex/`, `plugin/autolearn.js` |
| Multi-Persona | [LLD](./designs/sync/persona-LLD.md) | [EARS](./designs/sync/persona-EARS.md) | `autolearn.py` (persona), `plugin/autolearn.js` |

### Deferred (designed, not yet implemented)

- `sync rotate-key` (SYNC-ENC-013) — re-encrypt all blobs with new password
- `sync pull --interactive` (SYNC-PROTO-011) — per-file conflict resolution prompt
- `sync push` all-personas iteration (SYNC-PER-012/013) — currently pushes active persona only
- Project-level `.autolearn-persona` file (SYNC-PER-014) — project-specific persona mapping
- Salt auto-bootstrap — Phase 1 requires manual `scp ~/.autolearn/.encryption_salt` to new machines

## Conventions

- **LLD** (Low-Level Design): describes a single component's architecture, data structures, and edge cases. One per feature area.
- **EARS** (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax): testable requirement specifications using the `WHEN <trigger> THE SYSTEM SHALL <behavior>` form. Each LLD links to its EARS files.
- Code references in EARS use `@spec <ID>` tags that map back to LLD section IDs.
